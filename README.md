# Mini-Project-Data-Science
Small data science project to publish on GitHub. The focus is reproducibility and demonstrating git skills, not complexity.

# Introduction
This project was made for my Data Science 1 class. It is based on a dataset gotten from Kaggle named Clothes Price Prediction. This dataset wanted to predict the pricing of clothes according to their features.


# Requirements from the professor

Reproducibility (3 pts): Follow the principles of reproducibility discussed in class: clear folder structure, raw data included, all analysis steps included in code, output created automatically. Goal is that an independent peer should be able to reproduce it with no (or minimal) modifications.

Environment (3 pts): Project should be easy to reproduce (ideally with one click). You should define the environment or requirements for this.

Documentation (3 pts): Provide a well-structured README.md using proper Markdown formatting. The README should briefly describe your project, data, folder structure, requirements, steps to reproduce and other necessary notes.

Analysis (3 pts): Perform a very basic analysis. Minimal cleaning if needed, then one descriptive statistic or a simple graph is enough. Code must be clean and easy to follow.

Version Control (3 pts): Use Git properly with at least 3 meaningful commit messages (additional to the init).
